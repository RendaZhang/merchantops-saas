# Changelog

This file tracks release-level changes that matter to users, reviewers, and future open-source collaborators.

Low-level implementation steps stay in Git commit history. This changelog is intentionally version-oriented instead of day-by-day development-oriented.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Reframed the project plan as a 10-week workflow-first, AI-enhanced vertical SaaS roadmap.
- Clarified the project progression as portfolio first, open-source second, and potential commercial exploration later.
- Aligned version planning with the existing `v0.1.0` tag instead of reusing that version number for later milestones.

### Added

- Added AI reference docs for workflow integration, provider configuration, prompt versioning, eval datasets, and candidate workflow rollout.
- Added AI governance ADRs for workflow placement, audit and evaluation baseline, and instance-level provider-key ownership.
- Added an explicit release-versioning reference page to define tag ownership and future version progression.

### Docs

- Expanded README and docs navigation so project plan, release versioning, AI docs, and AI runbooks are easier to discover.
- Updated status and roadmap docs to reflect the current Week 2 position and the open-source release track.

## [v0.1.0] - 2026-03-09

Tagged as `Week 1 complete: foundation phase`.

### Added

- Multi-module Spring Boot backend foundation for a tenant-aware SaaS system.
- Local development support for MySQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, Docker Compose, and Flyway migrations.
- JWT login, Bearer-token authentication, tenant and user context propagation, and endpoint-level RBAC checks.
- Public foundation endpoints including `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `GET /api/v1/user/me`, `GET /api/v1/context`, and `GET /api/v1/users`.
- Swagger / OpenAPI support, request tracing, unified API response handling, and health checks.

### Changed

- Standardized the current-user endpoint to `GET /api/v1/user/me`.
- Improved Swagger contract coverage, reusable examples, and demo-account consistency.
- Strengthened demo seed consistency through follow-up migration and documentation cleanup.

### Docs

- Split high-level status, roadmap, reference docs, runbooks, and ADRs into a clearer documentation structure.
- Added API demo requests, regression guidance, and reference pages for authentication, Swagger, configuration, and user management.
